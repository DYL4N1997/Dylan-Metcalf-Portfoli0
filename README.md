Web development portfolio for Dylan Metcalf


This project is still not finished however will be updated conssitently during this course with my submitted projects. (CSS will be annotated also)

The project is a portfolio page about myself Dylan Metcalf, it includes:

- A header with navbar that scrolls to relevant information
- An About me section giving information about myself
- A work section, which enables viewers to interact with the webpage and hover over cetain projects I will be completing
- Finally, there is contact details in the footer that link my relevant details


- my motivation was to work on developing my HTML & CSS skills further, which was accomplished,ultimately resulting in a Portfolio page
- I learnt how to use CSS flexbox effectively.

Will update more when required.
